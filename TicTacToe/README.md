# Tic Tac Toe
An app to play the game Tic Tac Toe, built using React.
Users can select the board size (3x3, 4x4 or 5x5) and play a game. 
Moves are made alternately by player 'X' and player 'O' in the grid squares of the board until a winner is found or all squares are used (game over). 'X' always starts. 
A player wins by having a full row, column or diagonal of their symbol. The board can be reset to the beginning at any time during play and at the end. Similarly, the board size can be changed at any time (and the board is reset).
